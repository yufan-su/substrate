# Egress Demo — Pluggable Egress Networking

This demo shows an Actor's outbound traffic being **transparently tunneled through an
egress gateway** and **authenticated by actor identity**, end to end. The same demo runs
with either Envoy or [agentgateway](https://agentgateway.dev/).

The Actor is a tiny service that accepts `{"url":"..."}`, performs an HTTP `GET`, and returns
the upstream response. The Actor believes it is dialing plain HTTP directly — but its egress is
intercepted and carried over mTLS to a gateway that verifies who is making the request.

## What it demonstrates

     real destination (the CONNECT authority, an IP:port)
```

1. **Guide 1 - gateway accepts CONNECT + mTLS.** `atenet-egress` terminates the actor's mTLS `CONNECT` and
  tunnels to the requested destination.
2. **Guide 2 — transparent interception.** `nftables` REDIRECTs actor TCP egress into `atunnel`,
   which wraps it in mTLS + `CONNECT`.
3. **Guide 3 — HTTP-only actors, identity carried by the certificate.** The Actor only dials plain
   HTTP. atunnel presents the actor's own certificate — minted per actor by ateapi off the
   actor-identity CA, carrying an `ActorIdentity` X.509 extension — and sends a bare `CONNECT`
   with no identity headers at all.
4. **Identity authentication.** The gateway requires a client certificate signed by the
  actor-identity CA, so a non-actor client is refused at the handshake. It authorizes the
  certificate against the ATE API and rejects it unless the certified **UID** matches a real,
  `RUNNING` actor.
5. **Policy authorization.** What goes through the tunnel is checked against the Actor's
  `EgressPolicy`: the address rules (`ip_blocks`, `all`) once per connection at the `CONNECT`,
  against the original `IP:port`; the hostname rules on every request the gateway can read
  (cleartext HTTP, or TLS the sdsmint gateway terminates). TLS the plain gateway does not
  terminate, and opaque TCP, are allowed by address only. An Actor with no policy gets no
  tunnel at all.

## Choose a dataplane

The dataplane is selected when installing `ate-system`, not when installing this demo. The Actor,
ActorTemplate, worker pool, test, and manual walkthrough are otherwise the same.

```bash
# Envoy (default)
./hack/install-ate-kind.sh --deploy-ate-system

# agentgateway
./hack/install-ate-kind.sh --deploy-ate-system --atenet-router=agentgateway
```

| | Envoy | agentgateway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Select with | `--atenet-router=envoy` (default) | `--atenet-router=agentgateway` |
| Egress routing | Dynamic forward proxy | Dynamic backend from CONNECT authority |
| Actor authentication | Co-located atenet `ext_proc` | Built-in `substrateEgress` policy |
| Configuration | Envoy bootstrap in `atenet-egress.yaml` | Static agentgateway ConfigMap overlay |
| Access log | Text beginning with `[egress]`, including actor SAN | Structured log including `substrate.connect.authority` |
| MITM mode | Supported with `--experimental-use-sdsmint` | Supported with `--experimental-use-sdsmint` |

The experimental additional egress `ext_proc` service currently requires Envoy; the installer
rejects that option with agentgateway rather than silently omitting it.

## Components

- **Egress app (`main.go`)** — the Actor: `POST /` with `{"url":"..."}` → fetches it → returns
  status + body. It also serves `POST /grpc`, described below.
- **Egress gateway** — the `atenet-egress` Deployment. Envoy uses a co-located atenet `ext_proc`
  container started with `--mode=egress`; agentgateway uses its built-in `substrateEgress` policy
  and does not need that sidecar. The installer renders the matching configuration and container.
- **Egress opt-in** — `ate-api-server --egress-gateway-address=atenet-egress.ate-system.svc:443`
  (set in `manifests/ate-install/ate-api-server.yaml`). ateapi stamps the address onto every
  atelet `Run`/`Restore`, which turns on tunneled egress cluster-wide.
- **Egress policy** — the gateway denies by default, so the demo Actor needs an `EgressPolicy`
  (created through the `CreateActorEgressPolicy` API against the Actor) before its fetches
  succeed. `kubectl ate` has no verb for it yet; the e2e suites create theirs with
  `e2e.EnsureEgressPolicy`, and an `all` rule reproduces the pre-policy behavior.
- **Actor-identity trust** — the gateway mounts the `actor-id-ca-certs` Secret, a cert-only copy of
  the actor-identity CA root that `hack/install-ate.sh` derives from `actor-id-ca-pool` (which also
  holds the CA signing key and is deliberately *not* mounted here).

## Prerequisites

- A kind cluster with Agent Substrate installed (`hack/create-kind-cluster.sh`, followed by one of
  the [dataplane installation commands above](#choose-a-dataplane)). Egress is enabled by the
  ateapi flag above.
- `ko`, `kubectl`, and `kubectl-ate` (`go install ./cmd/kubectl-ate`).

## Deploy the demo fixture

```bash
./hack/install-ate.sh --deploy-demo-egress
```

The install applies the worker pool, creates the `ate-demo-egress` atespace and
the `egress` ActorTemplate (a substrate resource, not a CRD) through the ate
API, and blocks until the template's golden snapshot is built:

```bash
kubectl ate get actor-template egress -a ate-demo-egress
```

## Run the automated test (easiest)

```bash
./demos/egress/test-egress.sh
```

It detects the deployed dataplane, deploys an in-cluster HTTP target, creates and resumes an Actor,
then asserts:

- **positive** — a real Actor's egress reaches the target (`HTTP 200`) *through the gateway*
  (the target sees the gateway's IP as its client), and the gateway logs the CONNECT. Envoy's log
  includes the actor certificate SAN; agentgateway's structured log includes the authority;
- **negative** — a pod holding a valid *pod* identity but no actor certificate cannot open a
  tunnel at all: the gateway trusts the actor-identity CA, so the mTLS handshake is
  refused before any CONNECT is answered.

Add `--cleanup` to remove everything the script created.

## Manual walkthrough

```bash
# 1. An in-cluster target the Actor will fetch (any HTTP server works).
kubectl create namespace egress-target
kubectl -n egress-target create deployment whoami --image=traefik/whoami
kubectl -n egress-target expose deployment whoami --port=80
TARGET_IP=$(kubectl -n egress-target get svc whoami -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')

# 2. Create and resume an Actor in the demo's atespace: --template-ref
#    resolves the template by name within the actor's own atespace.
kubectl ate create actor egress-demo -a ate-demo-egress --template-ref egress
kubectl ate resume actor egress-demo -a ate-demo-egress   # wait for ACTOR_STATE_RUNNING

# 3. Drive the Actor's egress through the ingress gateway.
kubectl -n ate-system port-forward service/atenet-router 8000:80 &
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/ \
  -H 'Host: egress-demo.ate-demo-egress.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"url\":\"http://${TARGET_IP}:80/\"}"
```

### What to observe

With Envoy:

```bash
# The egress gateway logs each tunneled CONNECT against the verified peer certificate:
kubectl -n ate-system logs deploy/atenet-egress -c envoy | grep '\[egress\]'
#   [egress] authority=<TARGET_IP>:80 peer_san=spiffe://substrate-actor.local/atespace/ate-demo-egress/actor/egress-demo … code=200 …

# The co-located ext_proc sidecar logs the identity decision, including the UID it authorized on:
kubectl -n ate-system logs deploy/atenet-egress -c ext-proc | grep -i 'egress tunnel opened\|egress denied'
#   egress tunnel opened: an address rule allows the destination  leg=egress actor=ate-demo-egress/egress-demo actorUid=… destination=<TARGET_IP>:80 rule=0
```

With agentgateway:

```bash
# The structured access log includes the CONNECT authority:
kubectl -n ate-system logs deploy/atenet-egress -c agentgateway \
  | grep 'substrate.connect.authority'
```

The `whoami` body shows `RemoteAddr: <atenet-egress pod IP>` — proof the request egressed
*through* the gateway rather than directly.

## gRPC over the same tunnel

`POST /grpc` with `{"target":"<ip>:<port>","message":"hello","streamCount":2,"bidiCount":2}` makes
the Actor dial that address as a cleartext-HTTP/2 gRPC server and return what came back:

```json
{
  "message": "hello",
  "stream": [{"message":"hello","index":0},{"message":"hello","index":1}],
  "bidi":   [{"message":"hello-0","index":0},{"message":"hello-1","index":1}],
  "code":   "OK"
}
```

One RPC per streaming shape, because each fails differently over a network path:

- **unary `Echo`** — always run. Its status arrives in trailers, *after* the response body, which
  is what `code` reports and what a path that dropped trailers or downgraded to HTTP/1.1 could not
  produce.
- **server-streaming `EchoStream`** — when `streamCount` is positive. Many frames over one
  held-open connection.
- **bidirectional `EchoBidi`** — when `bidiCount` is positive. The Actor sends each message only
  after reading the response to the previous one, then half-closes the request direction while the
  response direction is still open. A path that serialized the two directions hangs here rather
  than answering short.

The gateway terminates the `CONNECT` and relays opaque TCP, so all of this crosses it untouched. A
failed RPC answers `502` and still carries its gRPC code in the same field.

`internal/e2e/suites/networking` drives this endpoint against the `testserver` fixture's `grpc`
subcommand (`internal/e2e/fixtures/testserver`, deployed by `e2e.DeployServerPod` from the shared
server-pod manifest) in `TestActorEgressGRPC`; the same fixture, or any h2c gRPC server reachable
from the cluster, works for a manual run.

## Notes / limitations

- The gateway **authenticates** identity (is this a real, running actor?) and **authorizes**
  destinations against the Actor's `EgressPolicy`. Injecting upstream credentials/tokens is a
  follow-up in the same `ext_proc`; a policy rule that declares an injection is denied (501)
  until it lands.
- `test-egress.sh` creates and resumes the Actor but cannot create its `EgressPolicy` (no CLI
  verb yet), so its positive fetch needs the policy created out of band first.
- Identity comes entirely from the actor certificate: the atespace, actor name, and UID are read
  out of the `ActorIdentity` extension and the UID is matched against the live actor, so a
  certificate cannot survive its actor being deleted and recreated under the same name. Nothing
  the actor can write into the CONNECT contributes to the decision.

## Cleanup

```bash
./demos/egress/test-egress.sh --cleanup
./hack/install-ate.sh --delete-demo-egress
```
