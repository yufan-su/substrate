# --experimental-egress-credential-injection turns on egress credential
# injection on the sdsmint egress gateway's decrypted MITM leg. The injection is
# performed by the egress gateway's own co-located atenet router sidecar, which
# the MITM leg already calls over ext_proc to enforce the actor's EgressPolicy;
# turning injection on is only a matter of pointing that sidecar at a credential
# provider. Enabling it splices the --credential-provider-* flags into the
# sidecar over the #ATE_EGRESS_INJECT_FLAGS marker in
# atenet-egress-with-sdsmint.yaml.
